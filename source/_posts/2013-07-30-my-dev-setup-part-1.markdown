This is going to be series about I have set up my primary code writing
machine. Recently I was showing a friend of min who is new to writing
code how git works. When I showed him my command line/text editor he

wrote him an e-mail but it just didn't get into enough detail for my

expect everyone to have the same taste as I do. It is something that
comes from experimentation, imitation and to some extent, experience.
That being said, here's what currently works for me.
